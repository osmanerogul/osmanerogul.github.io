I earned my BSc degree from the Electrical-Electronics Engineering Department at the Military Academy, followed by an MSc degree from the Department of Electrical-Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University. Subsequently, I completed my PhD degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering at Ankara University. Throughout my career, I've held various positions, including serving as the head of the Biomedical Engineering Centre and the Medical Design and Manufacturing Centre at GÃ¼lhane Military Medical Academy (GATA). Additionally, I worked as a research scientist at the Communications Research Centre in Ottawa, Canada.

I pursued extensive studies in the USA, Germany, Holland, and Japan, focusing on medical imaging systems such as Computed Tomography, Digital Angiography, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems.

My contributions extend to numerous scientific papers, books, book chapters, and patents, spanning areas such as medical devices, physiological signal and speech processing, sleep signals processing, medical image processing, and the design and manufacturing of custom-made implants.

Currently, I hold the position of the representative of Turkey for the Medical Applications of KT Forum in CERN. Since 2013, I have been serving as the head of the Biomedical Engineering Department and director of the Graduate School of Natural and Applied Sciences at TOBB University of Economics and Technology.
