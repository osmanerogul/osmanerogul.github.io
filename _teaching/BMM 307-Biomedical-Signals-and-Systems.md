The course covers acquisition, analysis, and processing of signals from the human body, exploring topics like signal characteristics, instrumentation, and system design for medical diagnostics and monitoring. 

Topics 
======
This course covers essential topics in biomedical engineering, focusing on;
<ul>
  <li>focusing on physiological signals (ECG, EEG, EMG, EOG, ENG) and physiological control systems</li>
  <li>signal representation in both time domains and frequency domains</li>
  <li>continuous and discrete signals</li>
  <li>explore key concepts like doubling of continuous time and discrete time signals</li>
  <li>linear time-invariant systems</li>
  <li>eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, Laplace transform, transfer function, Fourier series, Fourier transform</li>
  <li>multidimensional signals and systems, including the two-dimensional Fourier transform.</li>
</ul>
Students gain a foundational understanding for informed decision-making in scientific and healthcare contexts.

The course equips students to apply signal processing techniques in the biomedical field.
