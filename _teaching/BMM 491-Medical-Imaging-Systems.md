# Topics

**Multi-Dimensional Signal Processing**

Involves the analysis and manipulation of signals with more than one independent variable, often used in medical imaging for processing data from various dimensions.

**X-Ray Imaging Systems**

Utilizes X-rays to create images of the internal structures of the body. Commonly used for bone imaging and detecting abnormalities.

**Digital X-Ray Equipments**

Replaces traditional film-based X-ray systems with digital detectors, allowing for faster image acquisition, improved quality, and easier storage.

**Digital Angiography**

Specialized X-ray imaging for real-time visualization of blood vessels, commonly used in cardiology and vascular surgery.

**Computed Tomography (CT)**

Combines X-rays and computer processing to produce cross-sectional images of the body, valuable for detailed imaging in various medical fields.

**Image Reconstruction Algorithms of Computed Tomography**

Transforms raw data into detailed images through complex mathematical processes, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

**Ultrasound and Color Doppler Echocardiography**

Uses sound waves for imaging internal structures; Color Doppler adds the ability to visualize blood flow, commonly used in cardiac imaging.

**Gamma Camera Equipments**

Used in nuclear medicine to detect gamma rays emitted by radioactive tracers, providing images reflecting tracer distribution.

**Magnetic Resonance (MR) Physics**

Involves the principles of magnetic resonance, crucial for optimizing imaging parameters and obtaining high-quality MRI images.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems**

Utilizes strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues and organs, without ionizing radiation.

**Image Reconstruction Methods in MR**

Sophisticated algorithms are employed to generate meaningful images from acquired data, enhancing spatial and contrast resolution.

**Thermal Imaging Systems**

Detects and visualizes infrared radiation emitted by objects, used for diagnostic purposes and monitoring physiological changes.

**Optical Imaging Systems**

Uses visible, ultraviolet, or infrared light to create images of biological tissues, applied in various medical fields for diagnostics and research.
